## 1. Basics of F-strings

F-strings, or **formatted string literals**, were introduced in **Python 3.6** (PEP 498) and provide a highly readable and efficient way to embed Python expressions inside string literals.

**Syntax:** You create an F-string by prefixing the string literal with the letter `f` or `F`. Inside the string, you enclose Python expressions within curly braces `{}`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime and their results are formatted into the string.

```python
language = "Python"
version = 3.10

# Basic F-string
message = f"We are using {language} version {version}."
print(message)
# Output: We are using Python version 3.10.
```

Compare this to older methods:

*   **%-formatting (older style):**
    ```python
    message_percent = "We are using %s version %.2f." % (language, version)
    print(message_percent) # Output: We are using Python version 3.10.
    ```
*   **`str.format()` method (Python 2.6+):**
    ```python
    message_format = "We are using {} version {}.".format(language, version)
    print(message_format) # Output: We are using Python version 3.10.

    message_format_named = "We are using {lang} version {ver}.".format(lang=language, ver=version)
    print(message_format_named) # Output: We are using Python version 3.10.
    ```

While the older methods work, F-strings are generally preferred for their conciseness and readability – the variables/expressions are right where they appear in the output string.

**Key points about F-strings:**

*   **Expression Evaluation:** Anything inside `{}` is treated as a Python expression and evaluated in the current scope.
*   **Readability:** Expressions are embedded directly, making the string's intent clearer than placeholders or separate arguments.
*   **Conciseness:** Often requires less code than `.format()` or %-formatting.
*   **Performance:** F-strings are generally faster than other methods because they are parsed directly into efficient bytecode.
*   **Version Requirement:** Requires Python 3.6 or newer.

---

## 2. Variable Insertion

The most common use of F-strings is inserting the values of variables directly into a string.

```python
name = "Alice"
activity = "programming"
hours = 4

# Simple variable insertion
greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
status = f"{name} spent {hours} hours {activity} today."

print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(status)   # Output: Alice spent 4 hours programming today.
```

**Key considerations:**

*   **Automatic Conversion:** F-strings automatically call the equivalent of `str()` on the variable's value before inserting it. You don't need `str(hours)`.
    ```python
    count = 10
    item = "apples"
    message = f"There are {count} {item}." # count is automatically converted to '10'
    print(message) # Output: There are 10 apples.
    ```
*   **Scope:** Any variable accessible in the current scope where the F-string is defined can be used inside the curly braces.

---

## 3. Expressions in F-strings

F-strings aren't limited to just variables; you can embed almost *any* valid Python expression inside the curly braces `{}`. The expression is evaluated, and its result is formatted into the string.

```python
a = 5
b = 10

# Arithmetic operations
calculation = f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {a + b}."
print(calculation) # Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.

# Function calls
name = "Bob"
greeting = f"Hello, {name.upper()}!" # Calling the .upper() string method
print(greeting) # Output: Hello, BOB!

def get_status(user_id):
  # In a real app, this might query a database
  return "Active" if user_id % 2 == 0 else "Inactive"

user_id = 124
status_message = f"User {user_id}'s status is: {get_status(user_id)}"
print(status_message) # Output: User 124's status is: Active

# Accessing list/dictionary elements
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
my_dict = {"item": "widget", "price": 9.99}
list_access = f"The second element is {my_list[1]}."
dict_access = f"The {my_dict['item']} costs ${my_dict['price']}."
print(list_access) # Output: The second element is 20.
print(dict_access) # Output: The widget costs $9.99.
```

This allows for powerful inline computations and formatting directly within the string literal.

---

## 4. Formatting Options

F-strings support a powerful **format specification mini-language** *inside* the curly braces, following the expression, separated by a colon `:`. The syntax is `{expression:format_specifier}`.

### 4.1 Precision in Floating-Point Numbers:

Use `:.nf` to format a floating-point number to `n` decimal places.

```python
pi_value = 3.1415926535
price = 49.95

formatted_pi = f"Pi (3 decimals): {pi_value:.3f}"
formatted_price = f"Price: ${price:.2f}" # Common for currency

print(formatted_pi)    # Output: Pi (3 decimals): 3.142 (Note: it rounds)
print(formatted_price) # Output: Price: $49.95
```

### 4.2 Integer Formatting:

Format integers, often used for padding with zeros or spaces. Use `:nd` for decimal integers, where `n` is the minimum width. Use `0` before `n` for zero-padding.

```python
quantity = 42
item_id = 7

formatted_quantity = f"Quantity: {quantity:4d}" # Pad with spaces to width 4
formatted_id = f"Item ID: {item_id:03d}"    # Pad with zeros to width 3

print(formatted_quantity) # Output: Quantity:   42
print(formatted_id)       # Output: Item ID: 007
```

### 4.3 Alignment:

Control the alignment within a specified width using `<` (left), `^` (center), `>` (right). You can also specify a fill character before the alignment operator.

```python
message = "Python"
value = 123

# Align within a width of 10 characters
left_aligned = f"Left: |{message:<10}|"
center_aligned = f"Center: |{message:^10}|"
right_aligned = f"Right: |{message:>10}|"

# With fill character '*'
filled_center = f"Filled: |{message:*^12}|"
filled_right_num = f"Number: |{value:*>8}|" # Right align number, fill with *

print(left_aligned)     # Output: Left: |Python    |
print(center_aligned)   # Output: Center: |  Python  |
print(right_aligned)    # Output: Right: |    Python|
print(filled_center)    # Output: Filled: |***Python***|
print(filled_right_num) # Output: Number: |*****123|
```

### 4.4 String Truncation:

Limit the length of a string using `:.n`, where `n` is the maximum number of characters to display.

```python
long_text = "This is a very long piece of text that needs shortening."

truncated_text = f"Shortened: {long_text:.20}" # Display only the first 20 characters

print(truncated_text) # Output: Shortened: This is a very long
```

### 4.5 Date Formatting:

Use standard `datetime` formatting codes after the colon. You need to import the `datetime` module first.

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.now()

# Common date/time formats
formatted_date = f"Date: {current_date:%Y-%m-%d}"
formatted_time = f"Time: {current_date:%H:%M:%S}"
formatted_full = f"Full: {current_date:%A, %B %d, %Y %I:%M %p}"

print(formatted_date) # Output: Date: 2023-10-27 (example)
print(formatted_time) # Output: Time: 14:30:55 (example)
print(formatted_full) # Output: Full: Friday, October 27, 2023 02:30 PM (example)
```

These options provide fine-grained control over the final appearance of your strings.

## 5. String Manipulation with F-strings

You can perform many string operations *directly inside* the F-string's curly braces `{}`.

### 5.1 Concatenation with F-strings:

While F-strings excel at embedding, you can achieve concatenation simply by placing variables/expressions next to each other within the string.

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
title = "Dr."

# Effectively concatenates the parts
full_name = f"{title} {first_name} {last_name}"
print(full_name) # Output: Dr. John Doe
```

### 5.2 String Methods in F-strings:

Call any string method on the variable or expression inside the braces.

```python
text = "  extra whitespace  "
file_name = "report.TXT"

formatted_text = f"Stripped: '{text.strip()}'" # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
lower_filename = f"Lowercase: {file_name.lower()}"

print(formatted_text) # Output: Stripped: 'extra whitespace'
print(lower_filename) # Output: Lowercase: report.txt
```

### 5.3 Format Specification in F-strings (Recap):

As covered in Section 4, format specifiers control padding, alignment, precision etc.

```python
greeting = "Hi"
# Right-aligned, width 10, padded with '-'
formatted_greeting = f"{greeting:->10}"
print(formatted_greeting) # Output: --------Hi
```

### 5.4 Case Transformation in F-strings:

Use standard string methods for case changes.

```python
message = "python programming"
book_title = "the lord of the rings"

upper_message = f"Uppercase: {message.upper()}"
title_case_book = f"Title: {book_title.title()}"

print(upper_message)    # Output: Uppercase: PYTHON PROGRAMMING
print(title_case_book)  # Output: Title: The Lord Of The Rings
```

### 5.5 Dynamic String Manipulation (Conditional):

Combine expressions, including conditional (ternary) operators, for dynamic output.

```python
age = 25
score = 85

age_group = f"Age group: {'Child' if age < 18 else 'Adult'}"
result = f"Score: {score} - {'Pass' if score >= 50 else 'Fail'}"

print(age_group) # Output: Age group: Adult
print(result)    # Output: Score: 85 - Pass
```

---

## 6. F-string and Data Structures

F-strings make it easy to embed elements from dictionaries, lists, tuples, and other data structures.

### 6.1 Formatting Dictionaries with F-strings:

Access dictionary values using standard key notation `['key']` inside the braces. Remember to use different quote types for the f-string and the key if needed (e.g., f-string with double quotes, key with single quotes).

```python
person_info = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "Wonderland"}

formatted_info = f"{person_info['name']} is {person_info['age']} years old and lives in {person_info['city']}."
# Or using different quotes:
formatted_info_alt = f'{person_info["name"]} is {person_info["age"]}.'

print(formatted_info)     # Output: Alice is 30 years old and lives in Wonderland.
print(formatted_info_alt) # Output: Alice is 30.
```

### 6.2 Formatting Lists with F-strings:

Access list elements using index notation `[index]` inside the braces. You can also use methods like `.join()` often combined with generator expressions or list comprehensions for cleaner output of multiple elements.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
scores = [88, 92, 75]

first_fruit = f"The first fruit is {fruits[0]}."
average_score = f"Average score: {sum(scores)/len(scores):.1f}"

# Joining list elements (common pattern)
formatted_fruits = f"Available fruits: {', '.join(fruits)}"

print(first_fruit)      # Output: The first fruit is apple.
print(average_score)    # Output: Average score: 85.0
print(formatted_fruits) # Output: Available fruits: apple, banana, orange
```

### 6.3 Nested Data Structures in F-strings:

Access elements within nested structures by chaining the accessors.

```python
contact = {
    "name": "Bob",
    "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Metropolis", "zipcode": "12345"},
    "phones": ["555-1111", "555-2222"]
}

formatted_contact = f"{contact['name']}'s city: {contact['address']['city']}"
first_phone = f"Primary phone: {contact['phones'][0]}"

print(formatted_contact) # Output: Bob's city: Metropolis
print(first_phone)       # Output: Primary phone: 555-1111
```

### 6.4 Using Variables in Data Structure Formatting:

Combine variables defined outside the F-string with data structure access inside the braces.

```python
product = {"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200}
discount_percentage = 15 # Discount as a percentage

# Calculate discounted price inside the f-string
discount_decimal = discount_percentage / 100
formatted_price = f"The {product['name']} costs ${product['price'] * (1 - discount_decimal):.2f} after a {discount_percentage}% discount."

print(formatted_price) # Output: The Laptop costs $1020.00 after a 15% discount.
```

---

## 7. F-strings and Multiline Strings

F-strings work seamlessly with Python's triple-quoted strings (`"""..."""` or `'''...'''`) for creating multiline output.

### 7.1 Basic Multiline F-string:

Use `f"""..."""` or `f'''...'''`.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

multiline_output = f"""
User Profile:
  Name: {name}
  Age:  {age}
"""
# Note: The indentation inside the triple quotes IS part of the string.
print(multiline_output)
# Output:
# User Profile:
#   Name: Alice
#   Age:  30
```

### 7.2 Expression and Variable Insertion in Multiline F-strings:

Expressions work just like in single-line F-strings.

```python
radius = 5
pi = 3.14159

area_calculation = f"""
Circle Details:
  Radius: {radius}
  Area:   {pi * radius ** 2:.2f}
"""
print(area_calculation)
# Output:
# Circle Details:
#   Radius: 5
#   Area:   78.54
```

### 7.3 Conditional Statements in Multiline F-strings:

Embed ternary operators or other expressions for conditional text.

```python
status = "active"
role = "Admin"

user_message = f"""
User Information:
  Status: {status.capitalize()}
  Access: {'Full Access Granted' if role == 'Admin' and status == 'active' else 'Limited Access'}
"""
print(user_message)
# Output:
# User Information:
#   Status: Active
#   Access: Full Access Granted
```

### 7.4 Indentation and Formatting in Multiline F-strings:

Whitespace and indentation *inside* the triple quotes are preserved. This is useful for formatting code snippets or structured text.

```python
function_name = "greet"
parameter = "name"

code_block = f"""
def {function_name}({parameter}):
    '''A simple greeting function.'''
    print(f"Hello, {{{parameter}}}!")

#{function_name}("World")
"""
# Note the {{}} to escape the inner braces for the print() example
print(code_block)
# Output:
# def greet(name):
#     '''A simple greeting function.'''
#     print(f"Hello, {name}!")
#
# greet("World")
```

### 7.5 Combining Multiline and Single-Line F-strings:

You can concatenate or build up strings using both types as needed.

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 25
city = "Metropolis"

# Build parts and combine
header = f"--- User Record ---"
details = f"""
Name: {name}
Age:  {age}
City: {city}
"""
footer = f"--- End Record ---"

full_record = f"{header}\n{details}\n{footer}"
print(full_record)
# Output:
# --- User Record ---
#
# Name: Bob
# Age:  25
# City: Metropolis
#
# --- End Record ---
```

---

## 8. Advanced F-string Techniques

Beyond the basics, F-strings offer more advanced capabilities.

### 8.1 Dynamic Access using Variables:

Use variables inside the braces to dynamically access elements from collections.

```python
fruit_counts = {"apple": 10, "banana": 5, "orange": 8}
selected_fruit = "banana" # This could come from user input, etc.

# Access the dictionary using the 'selected_fruit' variable
count_of_selected = f"There are {fruit_counts[selected_fruit]} {selected_fruit}s."

print(count_of_selected) # Output: There are 5 bananas.
```

### 8.2 Attribute Access in F-strings:

Directly access attributes or call methods of objects within the braces.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def get_initials(self):
        return "".join(part[0].upper() for part in self.name.split())

person_instance = Person(name="Charlie Chaplin", age=88)

formatted_person = f"Person: {person_instance.name} (Age: {person_instance.age})"
initials = f"Initials: {person_instance.get_initials()}" # Calling a method

print(formatted_person) # Output: Person: Charlie Chaplin (Age: 88)
print(initials)         # Output: Initials: CC
```

### 8.3 Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator):

Use the concise `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false` syntax within braces.

```python
temperature = 15
weather_status = f"The weather is {'cold' if temperature < 10 else 'cool' if temperature < 20 else 'warm'}."
print(weather_status) # Output: The weather is cool.
```

### 8.4 String Joining with F-strings:

While `.join()` is standard, F-strings can be used within list comprehensions or generator expressions passed to `.join()`.

```python
greetings = ["Hello", "Hola", "Bonjour"]

# Format each greeting within the generator expression
joined_greetings = ", ".join(f"'{greeting.upper()}'" for greeting in greetings)

print(joined_greetings) # Output: 'HELLO', 'HOLA', 'BONJOUR'
```

### 8.5 Formatted Expressions with F-strings (Recap):

Combine complex expressions with format specifiers.

```python
values = [10.5, 22.1, 15.8]
average = sum(values) / len(values)

# Calculate average and format it
formatted_average = f"Average: {average:.2f}"
print(formatted_average) # Output: Average: 16.13

# Calculate within f-string and format
formatted_calc = f"Direct Average: {(sum(values) / len(values)):.2f}"
print(formatted_calc) # Output: Direct Average: 16.13
```

### 8.6 Escaping Characters in F-strings:

To include a literal curly brace `{` or `}` within an F-string, double it: `{{` or `}}`.

```python
# Need to show literal braces in the output
text_with_braces = f"To create an f-string, use f'{{expression}}'."
print(text_with_braces) # Output: To create an f-string, use f'{expression}'.

# Example with formatting AND literal braces
value = 10
formatted_with_braces = f"The value is {{{value:03d}}}" # Show {010}
print(formatted_with_braces) # Output: The value is {010}
```

---

## 9. Best Practices and Tips for F-string Formatting

To use F-strings effectively and maintain clean code:

1.  **Consistency:** Stick to one style (e.g., always use double quotes for f-strings unless inner quotes require singles).
2.  **Keep Expressions Simple:** Avoid overly complex logic or multiple lines of code *inside* the `{}`. If it gets complicated, calculate the value beforehand and insert the resulting variable.
    ```python
    # Less readable:
    # result = f"Final value: {(lambda x: x*x + 2*x + 1)(some_input):.2f}"

    # More readable:
    intermediate_value = (lambda x: x*x + 2*x + 1)(some_input)
    result = f"Final value: {intermediate_value:.2f}"
    ```
3.  **Use Descriptive Variable Names:** Clear names make f-strings self-documenting. `f"{user_name}"` is better than `f"{un}"`.
4.  **Escape Braces Correctly:** Remember `{{` and `}}` for literal braces.
5.  **Mind Line Length:** For very long strings or complex formatting, break them down or use multiline f-strings (`f"""..."""`). Adhere to PEP 8 line length guidelines where practical.
6.  **Leverage Format Specifiers:** Don't do manual padding or rounding if a format specifier can do it cleanly (e.g., use `{value:.2f}` instead of `round(value, 2)` inside the f-string if formatting is the main goal).
7.  **Combine Wisely:** Mix f-strings with regular strings if parts of the string are static.
    ```python
    base_url = "https://example.com/api"
    user_id = 123
    endpoint = f"{base_url}/users/{user_id}" # Combines static and dynamic parts
    ```
8.  **Test Incrementally:** For complex f-strings, print intermediate parts or test the expressions separately if you encounter issues.
9.  **Use Functions for Complex Logic:** Encapsulate complex calculations or formatting logic in functions and call them from within the f-string.
    ```python
    def format_user_status(user):
        # ... complex logic to determine status string ...
        return f"Status: {user.status} (Last Seen: {user.last_seen:%Y-%m-%d})"

    # Usage:
    status_line = f"User {user.id}: {format_user_status(user)}"
    ```
10. **Version Check:** Remember F-strings require Python 3.6+. Ensure compatibility if your code needs to run on older versions (though 3.6 is quite old now).
